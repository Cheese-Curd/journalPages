Well, the situation with Laurie ended.
Kara isn't angry
Laurie is angry
Elaina is hurt,
I'm angry, not at them, but at me

I shouldn't have said anything. None of this would've happened if I just let it

I need to let things go.
But I <b>can't</b>. No matter how hard I try. I can't do anything <b>Right</b>
