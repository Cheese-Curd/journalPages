As I walked out of my house and walked to my bus stop, I couldn't help it but to zone out, and at the bus stop, I spent all of it staring blankly into the water drops fall onto it, seeing the small and big ripples

<p style="text-align: center">It was calming.</p>

Now that I'm on the bus it's not very enjoyable. I'm back in my loop; I walk up, go to school, go home, sleep. At least it's Friday? I don't know, it doesn't seem like a Friday.

School days are beginning to blend into each other again. Jac doesn't DM me, nor does she even meet up with me. She told me if she was there once... Never again. It was a no anyways. Half of me thinks she doesn't like me, but the other half is remembering her words,
<p style="font-size: 48px; text-align: center">"I don't lose feelings."</p>
I don't know anymore man...
