Elaina and Caleb let me alone so I could write this. I've been thinking, about Jac. I've zoned out since before we left then after we went to Walkmart. Listening to BWU probably isn't helping, but it's how I feel.

I feel hurt.<br>
I feel alone.<br>
I feel lost.<br>
I feel unloved.<br>
<br>
Today was supposed to be a fun day, not... Whatever this is.
