Page was used as a "Content" page in the original journal.

So, I will use this section as notes.

Everything you see here is unchanged, misspellings included.
I am not going to censor anything here, this place is for my unfilted thoughts. It's how I think.

Also, I cannot draw digitally (nor really on paper), so the drawings won't be great, but that doesn't matter, does it?
<br>
With that being said, have fun reading.

What a wonderful way to start this.

I feel like shit.

I got desperate for an escape last might, so I said "fuck it" and got ont VRChat. I told Zumo and Kara that I was in VRC if they wanted to chill. Keep in mind my VRC status was "Please... Talk to me..."

They hardly acknowledged me. I started crying, Kara comforted me, Zumo did nothing. Neither of them have changed in that reguard. After I calmed down, I looked at my status again, anjd started to cry again. Zumo freaked out, and went "AFK" quotes intentional. Kara sent me a screenshot of what he DM'd her. He was <b>angry</b>.
